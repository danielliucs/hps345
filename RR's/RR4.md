Reading Response
The Promise of Artificial Intelligence - Reckoning and Judgment Chapters 5-7, 13
	This reading response will center on chapters 5-7 and a short conclusion of Cantwell Smiith’s book on The Promise of Artificial Intelligence - Reckoning and Judgment. The author begins with chapter 5, an introduction to contemporary machine learning (ML )and its improvements over GOFAI’s failures. The reading states that GOFAI had four failures: 
Neurological
Perceptual
Ontological
Epistemological
The reading argues that modern-day ML have improved on the neurological and perceptual failures of GOFAI with minimal improvement on the ontological and epistemological. Contemporary  ML have achieved this with techniques (neural networks) that are topologically similar to the way the brain is organized. The rest of chapter 5 understands contemporary ML with four facts: 
Correlations
Learning
Big Data
Computational power.
