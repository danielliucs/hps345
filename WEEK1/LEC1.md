# Lecture 1: Tools for thinking about AI and Automation

## Philosophy
* Perennial human practice
* Asking the big questions without much home of big answers
Tradition going back at least 2500 years in the West
* Other historical traditions exist dealing with these questions
* Luckily, conversation across traditions is possible, and often fruitful.
* Though underdeveloped, traditionally divided into 4 (interconnected areas):
### Ethics
* What to do? How to live? What's the good?
* E.g.. pleasure, love, honour, knowledge, virtue, truth, freedom?
### Metaphysics
* What is there? What is real?
* Are numbers real? Can there be diff kinds of reality? Are dreams real? Shadows? Ethics?
### Aesthetics
* How does perception work? (Broadly.) What is beautiful? (More narrowly)
### Epistemology
* What is knowledge? How do we know?
* Is knolwedge justified true belief?
* Nature of justification: foundationalists or coherentist?
* Therotical vs practical knowledge

* Most philosophical debates range between the 4 areas
* Coginitive science, debate ranges between metapphysics and aesthetics all the time
* And we touch on epistemology and ethics as well
* Philosphy is a method getting at presuppositions
* We try to be really clear on the concepts we're using
* We try to be really clear on what supports what
* We try to imagine the alternative explainations
* We try to imagine a world better than what we ahve

### History and philosophy of science
## Philosphy applied to science
* What is science?
* How does scinece work?
* What makes science a good method of generating knowledge?
* How should science work?

## Proto-Science
* When a field is starting out, it's often rifle with philosphical controversy
* Cognitive science is still pretty philosphical
## Meta-science
* Doing a sceince of science
* Asking big questions abt theory, data, the relation of the two, explanation, understand,
the relation of the two, objectivity, value-ladeness
* Science as a socially embedded phenomenon
* science and its relation to human values of all sorts
* Values in science
* Science's impact on values
## History of science
* More implicit than philosophy in this course, but still here
* AI is one in a series of psychotechnological revolutions
* Psychotechnology is a tool for cognition rather than the body
* Writing
* The printing press
* Radio and visual culture
* Social media
* Each revolution in psychotechnology has had massive impact on epistemic practices
* For better or worse
* Impacts are somewhat predictable
* Systems embed values that get passed uncritcally
* AI has rolled otu and will roll out in much the same way
* History sensitizes us to the difference betwee "pure" science and tehcnosciecne
* The latter is what's often most concerning
* History also sensitizes us to the polictal econonmy of AI
* Integration of History and Philosphy ideally.
* Too much philosophy: air gets thin, history groudns philosphical deliberation in rich detail
* Too much history: lose forest for trees
* Philosphy steps back from particulars to survey generatliites

* Integration is an endless project, but the push and pull of the two is very, very productive


## Ethics
* Assigned reading: Shafer-Landau (2009) - Introduction
* Good provisional defintiion of ethics
* A general map of the terrain
* A set of plausible starting points
* An intro to ethical argumentaiton ( and arguments in general)


* Ethics != law, etiquette, self-interest, tradition
* These may inform ethics but do not determin ethics
* Civil disobedience,
* Diogenese, righteous struggle
* Obligations, altruism
* Antebellum slavery, heternormativity
* Ethics = morality (in this context)
* Adjectives, not connotations

* Meta-ethics
* Value theory
* Normative ethics
* Applied ethics
* AI Ethics
* Ethics and politics
* Ethics is first and last philosophy
* Philospher life-cycle
* Ethics->everything else -> ethics

## Ethical starting points (in order of important for us)
* Might doesn't make right
* Self-interest isn't the only ethical consideration
* Neither the law nor tradition is immune from moral criticism
* We are not obligated to do the impossible
* Justice is a very important moral good
* Deliberately hurting other people requires justification
* Free and inforemd requests prevent rights violation
* Agony is bad
* Equals ought to be treated equally
* Everyone is morally falliable
* Friendship is valuable
* Children bear less moral responsibility than adults 

### Ethical argumentation
* Premises:
* The bases of support
* Conclusion:
* The statement of being supported
* Validty:
* Property of argument as a whole
* If the premises are true, the conclusion is true
* Soundness:
* Property of argument as a whole
* Argument is valid and premises are true
* Plausibility:
* A property of ideas and concepts
* Balance between evidence for turth and implications
