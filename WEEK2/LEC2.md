# More Tools for Thinking about AI and Automation


## Aim to cover two key ideas, bullshit, value-responsive ideals in science
1. Put the last two lecs together before we launch into some serious course content!!!
2. Have a good working defn of BS and some go to examples
3. Understand the need for vlaues in science, and the danger of that.
4. Have a view on what sort of values you'd like in science


It is just this lack of connection to a concern with truth-- this indifference to how things really are-- that I regard as of the essence of bullshit.

The essence of bs is not that it is fake but that it is phony. Ino rder to appreciate this distinction, one must recognize that a fake or a phony need not be in any respect (apart from authenticity) itself inferior to the real thing

## Bullshit
* We can all recognize instances of bullshit
* But some bs is of a very high quality
    * E.g. public relations
    * advertising, sales pitches
    * politcal campaigning
    * social media discourse

* We'll aim to be attuned to the intentional or unintentional bullshit
    * Teaching HPS is training in bullshit detection
    * Such skill makes better scientists, engineers, citizens.
    * Makes us worry about right htings, not (necessarily) about this trendy things

* AI Ethics and Bullshit
    * Teaser principle-based frameworks and their politcal toothlessness

## Science and Values
### Value-free ideal
    * In the context of justification, scientific inquiry should be driven only by epistemic and cognitive values.
        * Context of justification vs context of discoery
        * Epistemic values
            * E.g., simplicity, successful prediction, broad scope...
        * Cognitive vlaues
            * Fruitfulness
            * Sense that a theory could give rise to simplicity. prediction. broad scope...
        * Canons of inference
            * Rues for deciide to endorse a general claim from eivdence
    * So, a vlaue-free ideal excludes social and ethical vlaues from the canons of inference

### Possible alternatives to using social and ethical values to assess evidential sufficiency
* Flip a coin
    * But this is arbitrary, and still faces the issue of when coin-tossing is rquired
* Use science-internal standards
    * But this is arbitrary
    * Scientific work impacts other people as well
* Mandate scientists only report the inductive gaps
    * Impractical
    * People would have to leran how to assess evidence themselves
        * And have you met most people?

* Require scientists to only step across small inductive gaps
    * But this assumes only the risk of making a claim incorrectly matters

### Value-responsive ideals in science
* Argument from inductive gaps
    * We always already face a gap between the data and asserting a general claim about the data or deciding what to do on the basis of the data
        * The gap might be vast or it might be small, but it's always there
* Deciding on evidential sufficiency goes beyond epistemic and cognitive vlaues
* Need to consider the consequences of getting it wrong
    * Accepting wrong claims
    * Not accepting right claims
    * Accepting claims too early or too late
    * Social and ethical values help in determining what the best bet is
    * E.g., COVID vaccines testing and rollout


### Five ideals for value-responsive science
1. Prioritizing epistemic values
2. Role restrictions: social and ethical values cannot function as evidence
3. Getting the right values into science
4. Ensuring the proper community functioning
5. Ensuring good instituional structures for scientific practice

* Ample room for development

VALUES CANNOT SERVE AS A DIRECT ROLE!! to how evidence is presented. You can say evidence is insufficient of my values and my concern over false positives, so i want strong evidence before accepting that claim!


## Conclusion
Three lessons
1. Science is entangled with values
    * Pure science----------------------applied science--------------technology
    * Low stakes----------------------------------high stakes
    * Douglas' accoutn helps us come up with a framework for thinking in this domain

2. Ethics is about imagining what ought to be
    * Plausible starting points
        * Shafer-Landau helps us figure out what that is
    * Room for reasonable disagreement on premises
        * Reflection and god judgment is essential
    * Wishful thinking vs worthy ideas
        * Worthy ideals organize thought/action here and now
        

3. Politics lurks behind everything!
* Not politics as presented in the media
    * But politics as an ethos and guidance for collective action (or inaction)
        * A collective of what values are worth defending and which aren't
* In dicussing politics we have to accommodate and adjust for bullshit (more than usual).
   * Frankfurt helps us figure out what that is
        * one place to start: focus on interets, not on rhetoric
            * People are more driven by interest than by what they say, espeically in large groups
