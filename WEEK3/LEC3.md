# History and Philosphy of Artificial Intelligence 

## Introudction
### Aim
* Understand the actual capcities of AI technology
* In this lecture, we exmaine the prehistory and history of AI
* In the next lecture, we examine the technology as it exists now
### Learning Outcomes
* Have a rough sense of the historical trajectory of ideas and technologies leading to the first wave of AI
* Understand how first-wave AI understood intelligence and the mind
* Understand the reasons that first-wave AI failed in its ambitions
### Keywords
* Mechnical computation, Turing-completeness, Moore's law, first wave AI (GOFAI), Ai Winter, AI spring intelligence, representation, semantic interpretation, inference, formal tontology, normative assessement, non-effective tracking, perception, skillful coping, wordly complexity.

## AI: A Quick Timeline
* Prehistory of AI: antikythera mechanism (~200-~50BCE)
* 1800-1950: Special-purpose progammable automated systems
    * Jacquard loom (1802), analytical enginer (1847)
    * General analytical engine (1941)
* 1930s-1950: Foundational mathematical work in computing theory
* 1950s: Rapid improvement of computing machinery and its application to intellignece
    * Transistors, miniaturization, Moore's law
* 1960s-1970s: The first AI boom. First-generation AI, AKA GOFAI.
    * There was excitement the first time too.
* 1980s-~2010: AI Winter.
* ~20150-present: AI spring (second generation AI)
    * Excitement and anxiety

## The Promise of AI - Reckoning and Judgement
* A philosphical history of AI
* Forest first, trees second approach
* Sympathetic skepticism of AI
    * Contrast boosterism
        * "Within 10 years"
    * Contrast unsympathetic skepticism
        * "Impossibly arguments" (Searie, McGinn) 

## The Ethos of First-Generation AI (GOFAI)
* GOFAI operatoed on 4 vaguely Cartesian assumptions:

(C1) The essence of intelligence is thought: roughly, rationanl deliberation.

(C2) Ideal model of thought: logical inference based on "clear and distinct" concepts.

(C3) Perception is at lower level of thought, and will not be that conceptually demanding. They ignored this and used ideal model of thought first

(C4) Ontology of the world is "formal": discrete, well-defined, mesoscale objects. Objects exempllify properties and stand in unambiguous relations.

* On Physical causality and representation:
* (P1) The system works mechnically in ways explainable by science
    * No spooky stuff is needed
    * P1 - How (automatic) computers work.

* (P2) System's behaviour and constituents support semantic interpretation.
* System can be taken to be about the world
    * Both the system as a whole and the systems' constituents.
    * P2 - What computesr do
* (P3) The system is normatively assessed or governed in terms of the semantic interpretation
    * What makes systems right/wrong, say true/fasle things to be usefuluseless is its semantics

* On physical and causality and representation (continued):
* (P4) In general, semantic relations to the world (including reference), are not effective.
* We can't detect semantic relations casually!
    * This fact radically affects ontology
    * Causal influences fall away locally in spaec and time
    * Most of what we care about can't be read off a field of causal disturbance

* Intelligence involves finding the world as a whole intelligible
    * But we're only ever in direct contact with a minusucle portion of the world
    * Put it more strongly. The world's being beyond effective reach is the only reason we need reasoning at all
* We oreint to a world beyond effective reach by representing it
    * Representations stand in for distal states of affairs, and can be affected by local causal processess
    * To be useful, a representational system must be framed in terms of norms that are out of effective reach 

## The Failures of GOFAI
* On the failure of GOFAI
* (F1) Neurological Failure
    * Brain architecture can't be GOFAI architecture.
    * Brains are slow and massively parallel compaerd to GOFAI systems
* (F2) Perceptual Failure
    * Parsing the world through inputs is not a trivial task. It only seems simple for us.
* (F3) Epistemological Failure
    * Intelligence isn't just inference on articulated thought. Sometimes it's a skillful coping
    * Intelligence emereges against an unconscious backgroudn - an ineffable horizon of tacit knowledge and sense making
* (F4) Ontological Failure
    * GOFAI assumed that the world comces into neat ontologically discrete objects
