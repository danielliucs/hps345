Today's lecture was very interesting on the economic effects that AI could have. It was also very interesting to see the history of capitalism and its differences with AI capitalism. It was very interesting to see the still uncertain effects of AI and if it leans left or right on the political scale. One thing is for sure, it will disrupt the system but it was interesting to see that we don't know how it will yet. I would have liked to see if there could be potential for AI to not affect the system at all and to integrate seamlessly into society. Everything was clear in this lecture as usual :).
