As today marks the last lecture, this was a great course that helped me worry in a better way about AI and its implications in society. I learned and dived deeper into why AGI does not currently exist in today's society as well as how science consists of many values. I learned that there are many biases and flaws within current engineering and its implications it can have on society. Everything was clear as usual in this lecture :)
