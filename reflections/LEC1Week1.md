This reflection was written on September 12th about the lecture. The concept and idea that really resonated with me in this lecture was the idea of ethics. Ethics as a whole and how different people can perceive it in different ways and how it's such a complex topic in the field of AI. The idea of some of the terms (especially the longer ones) were a lot to take in initially but I'm sure I will get the hang of it once I review it. I would like to know more about the epistemic implications of AI that surely will come as the course progresses.
