This reflection is written on September 19th about the lecture. I found the concept of how there is a difference between bullshit and lying very interesting. My main takeaway from this is that bullshit is no acknowledgement that there even is a truth while lying at least acknowledges it is there. I found value-based science a very interesting interpretation on how science should be conducted. I agree that science should have value incorporated into it, in order to conduct morally and ethically correct science. I would like to know more about how to balance choosing the right values as well as maintaining a rich diverse environment in the scientic community. How would we find the perfect balance between different values from different backgrounds and what is right or wrong?
