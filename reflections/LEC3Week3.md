This reflection is written on September 26th about the lecture on the promise of AI. I found that it was very intersting that AI is divided into different subsections, AI winter vs AI spring for example. I also found it intersting that AI was divided into two different sagas, the GOFAI and the deep learning promise we see today. If time permitted, I would have liked to see more on the deep learning.
