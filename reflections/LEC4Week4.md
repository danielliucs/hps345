The idea that this second wave of AI models how the human brain works and takes inspiration from real life human brains is really interesting. The idea that the AI do not know what they are training on is a really interesting point as well and I wonder if this is something that will ever be addressed. If we fully understand the human brain then will we unlock the secrets in achieving general intelligence for AI models then?
