This lecture was really interesting in talking about the ethics of algorithms and of our technology. I would like to learn more about how there could be a potential balance between the requirements for large amounts of data in order for algorithms to be correct versus the ethical considerations of algorithms. Where would the balance be and how would we mitigate that. Black boxes not only abstract code but also abstract ethical considerations was a really interesting point. No concepts were unclear to me this lecture
