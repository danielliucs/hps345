I thought it was a very interesting lecture on the potential of AI work in psychotherapy. I especially liked the open question if there is a difference between an AI therapist and a human clinician.
I believe that human clinicians would seemingly be more relatable than a chatbot since you're talking face to face to a human. I would like to explore more on if there could potentially be a substitute for a human clinician vs a chatbot.
Everything in the lecture was clear :)
