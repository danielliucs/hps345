This lecture was clear as usual. I enjoyed the talk on epistemic attention for marginalized groups and the three effects that it creates: 
1. Incapable of influencing others' beliefs 
2. Limit of capacity to set the agenda 
3. Limit of capacity to establish the common ground 

I agree with these three points and thought they were very interesting. I would have liked to see if there are more effects on not giving epistemic attention where it was due and potential future possibilities if society continues to not pay sufficient epistemic attention to marginalized groups.
